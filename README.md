Okay, so here's what I did. I wrote a simple C program to convert a BMP(Bitmap) image to grayscale. 
Let me break it down:

Header Stuff: BMP images have a header that's 54 bytes long, which basically tells the computer how the image is structured. So, I made sure to copy that header exactly as is from the input file to the output file to keep things consistent.

Grayscale Calculation: To make an image grayscale, I needed to change each pixel's color. A pixel in a BMP file has three components: Red, Green, and Blue. To get the gray version of the color, I just averaged the three values using (r + g + b) / 3. It's not super fancy, but it works.

Reading and Writing Pixels: I used a loop to read each pixel's blue, green, and red values from the input file. Then, I calculated the grayscale value and wrote it three times (once for red, green, and blue) to the output file. This way, the image still looks like a grayscale version but uses the BMP format correctly.

Error Handling: I added basic checks to make sure the files open correctly. If there's an issue, the program will tell me and stop running.

In the end, I have a simple program that reads an image, makes it gray, and writes it back out. It's not the most efficient or advanced, but it's a good start for learning how image processing works in C!
